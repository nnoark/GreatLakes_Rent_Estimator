# Great Lakes Rent Estimator



GLRE is the fastest way to find out the "going rents" - anywhere in the Great Lakes States.


The Great Lakes Rent Estimator uses a machine learning model trained on over 51,000 recent rental listings on Craigslist within the Great Lakes States to predict the price of a rental listing based on common housing amenities. With GLRE, the market no longer has to remain a mystery. By analyzing the listings in the surrounding region, GLRE can calculate rent prices based on similar listings and provide a market rate estimate -- or let you know if you're currently paying too much.

The Libraries and tools used for the data cleaning, ML model and app development

* Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, Sklearn, pickle
* Pickle is a useful Python tool that allows you to save your models, to minimise lengthy re-training and allow you to share, commit, and re-load pre-trained machine learning models. Pickle is a generic object serialization module that can be used for serializing and deserializing objects.

The app is deployed on Heruko for public access.
